# Pokedex Demo Site
This is a simple Pokedex application for my portfolio. It calls the third party PokeAPI and displays pokemon data.
It showcases the following technologies:
- GQL (calls PokeAPI's Graph)
- SSR (rendered server side for a fast user experience as well as the valuable SEO)
- Using React MUI for a consistent UI 
- Performant (check out Lighthouse to view the Web Vital Scores ;))
- Simple Cyprus E2E and Component Testing

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
